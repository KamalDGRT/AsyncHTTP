# AsyncHTTP

A Swift wrapper for making asynchronous API calls.

- Implemented a generic HTTP Client to handle `GET`, `POST`,  `PUT`, `PATCH`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` requests.
- Added an example App demonstrating the usage of the app.
- The demo app contains a generalized wrapper for handling Cookies using SwiftData models.
